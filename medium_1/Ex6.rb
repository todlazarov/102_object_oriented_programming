# If we have these two methods:

class Computer
  attr_accessor :template

  def create_template
    @template = "template 14231"
  end

  def show_template
    template
  end
end

# and

class Computer
  attr_accessor :template

  def create_template
    self.template = "template 14231"
  end

  def show_template
    self.template
  end
end

# What is the difference in the way the code works?

# They are the same. The self is not necessary since we have access to the variable via the attr_accessor.
